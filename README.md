# Tableau_CitiBike
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
Task

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may use any dataset or combination of dataset. Be aware, however, that these csv's are very large. If you want to work with multiple csv's, you will have to do some aggregations using pandas and export smaller csv's. Otherwise, Tableau will break. Keep your project within the scope of the csv's.

Your final project must be cohesive. The point of visualizations is telling a story. Each visualization should stand on its own and be a part of the overall story. Are you presenting data on gender differences to to show the officials Citibike needs to change its model? Are you analyzing the difference between pre and post covid usage? Each visual should support this story.

You can also create your project for a different audience if you wish--Citibike Corporate for example.
